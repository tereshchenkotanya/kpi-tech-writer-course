# Social network for volunteers

## Description
This social network was created to help our volunteers and unite them on one platform. The platform could be useful for creating special groups which are related to helping our
people. These groups have chats to communicate with an owner of the community. You are able to create your own group and invite your friends, therefore you could be united and try
to help someone. The owner of a group is able to create their own posts about any topic and these posts could be shown on special page news that was created to share the most
important messages. The rating of each post is defined by the popularity of the article. You can also create your circle of friends and use a chat to discuss any topics with them.
